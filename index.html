      <p>As a motivated overseas student at St. Lawrence College, I am in my last year of the Computer Programming course. Here, I am sharpening my abilities in software creation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Having a robust base in programming, I look forward to using my understanding and enthusiasm to contribute to inventive projects and solutions within the technology industry.

        I possess various skills, which comprise mastery of English, French, and Arabic languages. My original language is Arabic. Such capability in languages improves my communication capacity greatly especially when working in environments with different people from diverse cultures or while cooperating with varied teams.
        
        Besides my scholarly endeavors, I am strongly interested in personal fitness and martial arts. Being a Moroccan champion in Shotokan karate shows that I am disciplined, resilient, and committed to high standards of excellence. My leisure activities are bodybuilding, MMA, and karate; these not only help maintain good physical health but also foster intense focus and resolve across all areas of my life.
        
        
        I desire to form connections with professionals who have similar thinking, guides, and institutions that appreciate creativity and innovation in technology. Let's work together to create a change in the world of tech!</p>
